# BatchRename
Sometimes, we want to rename list of files which share same pattern.

For example three files,
S1. Some File 1.txt
S2. Some File 2.txt
S3. Some File 3.txt

So we want to replace "Some File", part with "Hello".
So result will be,
S1. Hello 1.txt
S2. Hello 2.txt
S3. Hello 3.txt

In practice we rename files one by one.
But by using this project, if we spacify the directory with common text and replacing text, this project will do that for you.
No more manual renaming for huge list of files.

Detailed screenshots are given inside "Instructions" folder.
